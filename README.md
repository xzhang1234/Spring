springapp is a Spring MVC app by following the tutorial https://docs.spring.io/docs/Spring-MVC-step-by-step/.  

What I have learned from this tutorial:

  - object initialization in servlet.xml
  - access initialized object inside controller
  - pass objects to view
  - obtain input from form
- How to configure servlet.xml to attach controller, model and view 
- Typical file organization of Spring MVC app
- JUnit test
- Tomcat deploy and debug
